This project uses the "esco_v1.0.3.ttl" dataset, but it is too large for git (400+Mbs) so we gitignored it.

In order to get it, go to the oficial ESCO UE website and download it:
https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/download

And import it into Startdog after launching it, with "ESCO" as the repo name (Hyperfolio frontend app will query that repo on the default Satrdog port microsservice).

Download the "ESCO v1 classification / Full RDF v1.0.3 (472MB)" full version v1.0.3 - or a newer version release if compatible.
